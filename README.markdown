#Welcome To Tic Tac Toe

This is a console tic tac toe game that you can play in one of three ways.

1. Play against the computer
2. Play against a friend
3. Watch the computer play against itself (if you blink, you'll miss it.)

To play the game, `cd` into the tic_tac_toe_python directory then enter:

    python play_game.py

Then just follow the on-screen instructions. This game was tested on
Python 2.7.1 and 2.7.3

If you want to run the tests, you'll need the Mock framework. You can
download the framework from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock.
Unpack the downloaded file then `cd` into the unpacked file and run:

    python setup.py install

To run the tests, `cd` into the tic_tac_toe_python directory and enter:

    python -m unittest discover

If you don't have Python, go to  www.python.org/getit/ and click on the link
that says Python 2.7.3. Then choose the appropriate installer for your
system and install it.
