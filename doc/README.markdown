#Welcome To Tic Tac Toe
##Python Style

This is a console tic tac toe game that you can play in one of three ways.

*Play against the computer (go ahead, try to win)
*Play against a friend
*Watch the computer play against itself (if you blink, you'll miss it.)

To play the game, `cd` into the ttt directory then enter:

    python play_game.py

Then just follow the on-screen instructions. This game was tested on
Python 2.7.1

If you want to run the tests, you'll need the Mock framework. You can
download the framework from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock.
Unpack the downloaded file then `cd` into the unpacked file and run:

    python setup.py install

To run the tests, `cd` into the ttt directory and enter:

    python -m unittest discover
